{"name":"Native Bugscapes","tagline":"Turning California cities into diverse ecosystems, one yard at a time.","body":"Native Bugscapes brings native plants and insects – and the wildlife they support – to urban areas where they no longer exist. We are transforming cities from their current state – dominated by just a few species of non-native plants and insects – to healthy, natural ecosystems by creating a patchwork of biological hotspots through landscaping. Our approach is a hybrid of ecological restoration, plant-insect ecology and modern landscape design. \r\n\r\nCalifornia is facing a serious drought, a collapse in pollinator populations, and rampant overuse of dangerous pesticides. Our approach can help to address all of these challenges, while enhancing the beauty of urban landscapes.\r\n\r\nWe offer solutions for native species establishment and natural, permanent pest control without chemicals. \r\n\r\n[Restoration Landscaping Co.](www.restorationlandscaping.co/#utm_source=\"nativebugscapes.com\") is based in Sacramento, CA. We provide full-service landscaping as well as consulting. Please visit our main site to learn more.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
