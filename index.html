    <section class="main-content">
      <p>Native Bugscapes brings native plants and insects – and the wildlife they support – to urban areas where they no longer exist. We are transforming cities from their current state – dominated by just a few species of non-native plants and insects – to healthy, natural ecosystems by creating a patchwork of biological hotspots through landscaping. Our approach is a hybrid of ecological restoration, plant-insect ecology and modern landscape design. </p>

<p>California is facing a serious drought, a collapse in pollinator populations, and rampant overuse of dangerous pesticides. Our approach can help to address all of these challenges, while enhancing the beauty of urban landscapes.</p>

<p>We offer solutions for native species establishment and natural, permanent pest control without chemicals. </p>
